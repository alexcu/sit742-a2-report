\section*{Executive Summary}

This report summarises findings from a data exploration on the Hotel TULIP web server logs, recorded between the periods of August 2014 and August 2015. Each log contains one \textit{request}, or \textit{hit}, that lists fourteen attributes as described in the attached Data Dictionary spreadsheet. Publicly known client IP addresses were extracted from the MaxMind GeoIP2\footnote{See \url{http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/}.} dataset to analyse the location of requests (narrowed down to city). Additionally, user agent strings were parsed to analyse device and browser statistics using the Python \texttt{user-agents} library\footnote{See \url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/user-agents}.}, thereby extrapolating demographics, usage trends, platform information, server performance, and security statistics from the raw logs provided in the dataset. Further details on the extraction of the data is provided in the source code attached in Appendix~\ref{apx:results}, and an interactive version of this file is published on \href{https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/7364378259770565/3552971541306612/8155742302574378/latest.html}{Databricks}.

\section{Key Findings}

A list of key findings in the analysis are as thus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A majority of requests are from Hong Kong, specifically the Central District (Section~\ref{ssub:countries}).
  \item The number of requests made to the web server are increasing over time (Section~\ref{ssub:trends}).
  \item Response times to the server are getting slower (Section~\ref{ssub:response_times}).
  \item There are a number of increasing server errors (Section~\ref{ssub:server_errors}).
  \item The web server is most active at 9am UTC, with most requests made in March 2015 (Section~\ref{ssub:trends}).
  \item iOS is being used more than Android (Section~\ref{ssub:smartphone_adoption}).
  \item The server is generally secure with relatively few genuine repetitive unauthorised attempts (Section~\ref{ssub:security}).
  \item iPhone is being used more than iPad to request the server worldwide, but internally, guests use iPad more than iPhone (Section~\ref{ssub:device_cat})
  \item Windows was mostly used for requests made on PC devices (Section~\ref{ssub:pc_adopt}).
  \item Apple devices are primarily used around the world for smartphone and tablet requests (Section~\ref{ssub:smartphone_adoption}).
  \item Google is crawling at 16\%, over Bing and Facebook at 10\% and 4\% (Section~\ref{ssub:seo}).
\end{itemize}
