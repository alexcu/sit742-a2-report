\section*{Executive Summary}

This document reports session usage analysis on the Hotel TULIP website by investigating the frequency patterns of how people visited the website in a typical session. Following findings of Assignment 1, we juxtaposed session browsing between the following categories: (1) internal visitors (i.e., guests) of the website; (2) external visitors; (3) visitors from Hong Kong, the United States and Australia, being the top three countries identified who visit the website most; (4) differentiating usage patterns between PCs, Smartphone devices, Tablet Devices; and (5) how bots crawled the website. We developed a visual representation of these identified patterns and highlight areas where people are most likely to navigate between on the Hotel TULIP website to find more information about the hotel in differing fashions. Analysis was performed using the FPGrowth algorithm implementing using Apache Spark on the Databricks platform. Further details on the extraction implementation are attached and an interactive version of this file can be found on \href{\databricksurl}{Databricks}.
