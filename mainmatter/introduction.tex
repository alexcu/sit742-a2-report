\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Browsing patterns on the Hotel TULIP Weblogs were assessed in order to gain insight on how customers navigate through the website within a typical \textit{session}. A user session is defined as a typical visit to the website, and a collation of all the different \textit{informational resources} that were accessed. Information resources refer to web pages that contain primary content about the hotel and its facilities, rather than multimedia and technical-related resources.

In order to assess how \emph{different} customers do so, we extract different information based on the web log data format as prescribed in Appendix~\ref{app:data_dictionary}. We contrast those users who make requests:

\begin{itemize}
  \item internally, such as guests using the internet within the hotel's network,
  \item externally, such as prospective guests browsing the website for a potential stay in the hotel,
  \item from users within the top three countries that visit the  website (refer to Assignment 1), and
  \item between users on PCs, Smartphones, Tablets and Bots.
\end{itemize}

Each of these criteria were analysed against matching sessions that satisfy such criteria. Data mined using the Frequency Pattern was done so using the FPGrowth Algorithm in Apache Spark.
