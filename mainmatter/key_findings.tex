\section{Key Findings}
\label{sec:key_findings}

A list of key findings in the analysis are as thus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Internal visitors (guests) to the website tended to most frequently browse the `About the Hotel' page, then click into rooms and the read about the hotel's offers, though there is strong correlation between these visitors going from dining page into the offers page (Section~\ref{sec:results:ip_source:internal}),
  \item External visitors, however, most frequently viewed the `Above and Beyond' page first, then visited the `Facilities' page before reading about the hotel's rooms, though some also went from `Above and Beyond' directly to the offers and dining in the hotel (Section~\ref{sec:results:ip_source:external}),
  \item Visitors from Hong Kong usually followed similar patterns to those outlined above but in the inverse order of frequency (visited `Offers' and `Dining' more frequently) (Section~\ref{sec:results:countries:hk}),
  \item American visitors usually started by viewing the hotel's rooms, then the `Offers' made by the hotel, and lastly viewing `About the Hotel' itself (Section~\ref{sec:results:countries:us}),
  \item Australian visitors have a further broader visiting pattern, but most frequently viewed the `Above and Beyond' page first, then read about the hotel's facilities, and lastly reading about the hotel's Rooms (Section~\ref{sec:results:countries:au}),
  \item PC visitors most followed a frequency pattern similar to that of Australian visitors (Section~\ref{sec:results:platform:pc}),
  \item Smartphone visitors had narrow visiting patterns, but started browsing by viewing about the hotel's offers, then about the facilities of the hotel and lastly about the dining experience at the hotel (Section~\ref{sec:results:platform:smartphone}),
  \item Tablet visitors most frequently read first about the facilities of the hotel, then about the hotel's offers and lastly about the dining experiences (Section~\ref{sec:results:platform:tablet}),
  \item Bots crawled the website in a completely different fashion, by most frequently crawling between the `Our City' page, then about the `Location and Contacts' and lastly the `About The Hotel' page (Section~\ref{sec:results:platform:bots}).
