\subsection{Top Three Countries}
\label{sec:results:countries}

Visitors of the TULIP Hotel have been geolocated using their IP address (where possible) and the three most common countries have been selected for further analysis of user session patterns. These countries are Hong Kong, the United States and Australia. Assessment of how this data was collated can be found in Assignment 1.

\subsubsection{Hong Kong Visitors}
\label{sec:results:countries:hk}

Figure~\ref{fig:hk_requests} visualises the user sessions of Hong Kong visitors. Table~\ref{tab:hk_requests}  (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. The top three patterns identified by Hong Kong visitors are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `Dining',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `Dining',
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `Dining'
\end{enumerate}

Visitors from Hong Kong most commonly browse the TULIP Hotel website and end their session on the `Dining' page. We believe that, as these visitors are local to the area where the hotel is located, they may be intending to only eat at the hotel's restaurant(s), and are not necessarily looking to stay within the hotel. Also, most of these visitors are reaching the `Dining' page from the `Offers' page.

\paragraph{Proposed Suggestions} Using the information we have identified above, we suggest that a successful campaign targeted to Hong Kong visitors on the website, correlating offers for eating in at the hotel, would be a suitable way to attract more visitors to the hotel.

\subsubsection{USA Visitors}
\label{sec:results:countries:us}

Figure~\ref{fig:us_requests} visualises the user sessions where the IP address is geolocated from the United States. Table~\ref{tab:us_requests}  (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. We have identified the most common frequency patterns of American user sessions below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `About the Hotel',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `About the Hotel',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `About the Hotel'
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `About the Hotel'
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms'
\end{enumerate}

US visitors sequences largely differ compared to Hong Kong visitor patterns. The most common page where American visitors end their sessions are at the `Offers' and `About the Hotel'. Offers as an end page in a sequence is common amongst many visitors of different categories, however `About the Hotel' could be indicating that users are interested in learning more about the hotel which they are interested in staying at.

\paragraph{Proposed Suggestions} We propose that American visitors be shown a direct link displaying information about the hotel, which can navigate them quickly to this page (based on our analysis above). They tend to end up here on a typical session, so it is possible that it is this information that they are trying to find out most.

\subsubsection{Australian Visitors}
\label{sec:results:countries:au}

Figure~\ref{fig:au_requests} visualises Australian user sessions and pattern interaction. Table~\ref{tab:au_requests}  (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. We have identified the most common frequency patterns of Australian user sessions below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers',
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers',
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Rooms',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Offers'
\end{enumerate}

Australian visitor's sequence patterns are less varied in terms of the identified frequencies. It is possible that this may due to a smaller data set (less Australian visitors than either US or Hong Kong). Common end pages for an Australian visitors within a sequence are the `Rooms', `Offers' and `Facilities' pages.

\paragraph{Proposed Suggestions} It is common that Australian visitors tend to review the facilities first, before the Hotel's rooms and offers. Displaying these pages in such an order might be an option to explore for Australian visitors.
