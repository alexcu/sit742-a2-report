\subsection{IP Request Sources}
\label{sec:results:ip_source}

When a user of the TULIP Hotel website visits the website, their unique IP address is categorised as either \textit{internal} or \textit{external}. (Section~\ref{sec:method:extraction_process:ip_regex} explains how this categorisation process is achieved.) Internal IP addresses come from users who are within the network of the hotel---we assume this would usually mean that they are either using a networked computer within the hotel lobby, or are connected to Hotel TULIP's Wi-Fi network using their own personal device. External IP addresses refer to those users who are connecting to the server from outside the network (e.g., prospective guests).

Analysis as been performed on both internal and external users in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Internal Site Visitors}
\label{sec:results:ip_source:internal}

Figure~\ref{fig:internal_requests} visualises the frequency patterns found from internal visitors from the website. Table~\ref{tab:internal_requests} (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. We have identified the most common frequencies of user sessions within the hotel's network, ordered from most to least common below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Rooms' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
\end{enumerate}

The most common internal visitor pattern identified indicates that current visitors are looking to extend their stay or visit the hotel again at a later date. It may also be possible that these are not guests---they may be potential guests who are not checked in, have walked into the hotel, connected to the lobby's guest network and are interested in staying at the hotel, thereby using the internal network to find out more about the rooms, dining experiences, offers available and about the hotel's facilities.

Regardless of pattern, it is important to note that these visitors are guests most likely already staying at hotel, and this is influencing their visitor usage patterns.

\paragraph{Proposed Suggestions} Visitors connected to the internal network typically end their session on the `Offers' page---this information is useful and we suggest that the hotel prioritises the display of offers on its website more predominantly. This would attract more customers by presenting more offers when they are connected to the hotel's network.

\subsubsection{External Site Visitors}
\label{sec:results:ip_source:external}

Figure~\ref{fig:external_requests} visualises the frequency patterns found from external visitors. Table~\ref{tab:external_requests} (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. The external IP request sources are visitors to the TULIP hotel who are accessing the site outside of the TULIP Hotel network. Most visitors will fall into this category. We have identified the following patterns in external visitor's user sessions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `Dining',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Offers' \ra{} `Dining',
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Dining',
  \item `Above and Beyond' \ra{} `Facilities' \ra{} `Dining',
\end{enumerate}

We have identified that most common external user sessions navigate between a mix of `Above and Beyond', `Facilities', `Rooms' and `Dining'; this highlights a common interest of these users. Patterns also highly suggest that many users navigate to the `Offers' page, most commonly from `Above and Beyond' followed by `Rooms' and finally `Facilities'.

\paragraph{Proposed Suggestions} We propose that these patterns could be implemented into the UI of the website to highlight how room information is highly sought after---this could be made more prominent on the website, most particularly under the `Facilities' page, which will help users find the information they typically look for after reviewing what facilities the hotel has to offer. User sessions for this visitor category typically end at the `Offers', `Rooms' and `Dining'; we suggest these pages should be highlighted as closely as possible in the homepage as it shows what pages and information is most sought after by users once they have visited the website.
