\subsection{IP Request Sources}
\label{sec:results:ip_source}

When a user of the TULIP Hotel website visits the website, their unique IP address is categorised as either \textit{internal} or \textit{external}. (Section~\ref{sec:method:extraction_process:ip_regex} explains how this categorisation process is achieved.) Internal IP addresses come from users who are within the network of the hotel---we assume this would usually mean that they are either using a networked computer within the hotel lobby, or are connected to Hotel TULIP's Wi-Fi network using their own personal device. External IP addresses refer to those users who are connecting to the server from outside the network (e.g., prospective guests).

Analysis as been performed on both internal and external users in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Internal Site Visitors}
\label{sec:results:ip_source:internal}

Figure~\ref{fig:internal_requests} visualises the frequency patterns found from internal visitors from the website. Table~\ref{tab:internal_requests} (Appendix~\ref{app:additional_tables}) further extrapolates this data and identifies the frequency pattern values. We have identified the most common frequencies of user sessions within the hotel's network, ordered from most to least common below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Rooms' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `About the Hotel' \ra{} `Rooms'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Rooms' \ra{} `Offers'
  \item `Facilities' \ra{} `Dining' \ra{} `Offers'
\end{enumerate}


The most common internal visitor pattern identified indicates that current visitors are looking to extend their stay or visit the hotel again at a later date. It may also be possible that these are not guests---they may be potential guests who are not checked in, have walked into the hotel, connected to the lobby's guest network and are interested in staying at the hotel, thereby using the internal network to find out more about the rooms, dining experiences, offers available and about the hotel's facilities.

Visitors connected to the internal network typically end their session on the `Offers' page---this information is useful and we suggest that the hotel prioritises the display of offers on its website more predominantly. This would attract more customers by presenting more offers when they are connected to the hotel's network.

Regardless of pattern, it is important to note that these visitors are guests most likely already staying at hotel, and this is influencing their visitor usage patterns.

\subsubsection{External Site Visitors}

The external IP request sources are visitors to the TULIP hotel who are accessing the site outside of the TULIP Hotel network. Most visitors will fall into this category.

\label{sec:results:ip_source:external}

Sequences in order of sequence frequency:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Above and beyond \ra facilities \ra rooms (1823)
  \item Above and beyond \ra offers \ra dining (1760)
  \item facilties \ra rooms \ra offers (1732)
  \item facilties \ra offers \ra dining (1727)
  \item facilties \ra rooms \ra dining (1715)
  \item above and beyond \ra facilties \ra dining (1684)
\end{enumerate}

The most common visitor sequence of external visitors is: "above and beyond" \ra  "facilities" \ra  "rooms" - indicating a common interest of these users. This information could indicate to TULIP Hotel that room information is highly sought after, and could be made more prominant on the website, possibly under the facilities page which will help users find the information they are looking for.

Patterns also highly suggest that many users navigate to the offers page, most commonly from "above and beyond" followed by "rooms" and finally "facilities".

The most common end pages of sequences for this visitor category are offers, rooms and dining - indicating what pages and information is most sought after by users.

Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:external_requests}.
